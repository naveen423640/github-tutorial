Fork the target repo to your own account.
Clone the repo to your local machine.
Check out a new "topic branch" and make changes.
Push your topic branch to your fork.
Use the diff viewer on GitHub to create a pull request via a discussion.
Make any requested changes.
The pull request is then merged (usually into the master branch) and the topic branch is deleted from the upstream (target) repo.
